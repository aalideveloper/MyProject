        <h2>Concave Lens</h2>
        <p>A concave lens is a type of lens that is thinner in the middle than at the edges.
        This shape causes light rays to spread out or diverge when they pass through it.
        Concave lenses are also known as diverging lenses.
        They are commonly used in glasses to correct nearsightedness (myopia) by making distant objects appear clearer.</p>

        <h2>Convex Lens</h2>
        <p>A convex lens is a type of lens that is thicker in the middle than at the edges.
        This shape causes light rays to come together or converge when they pass through it.
        Because of this, convex lenses are also known as converging lenses.
        They are commonly used in magnifying glasses and to correct farsightedness (hyperopia) by making nearby objects appear clearer.</p>

    <div class="main" id="sec3">
        <h2>Oval Lens</h2>
        <p>An oval lens has an elliptical shape, which can be used in various optical applications.
        These lenses can focus light in a unique way due to their shape, often used in specialized optical instruments.</p>

    <div class="main" id="sec4">
        <h2>Transparent Lens</h2>
        <p>A transparent lens allows light to pass through without significant scattering.
        These lenses are used in a variety of applications where clear vision is required, such as in cameras, glasses, and microscopes.</p>
