<h1>Concave Lense Glasess </h1>
<P style="color: rgba(223, 144, 25, 0.932); text-align: center;"> <b><br> Concave lenses have at least one surface curved inside.<br><br> A concave lens is also known as a diverging lens. <br><br> It is shaped round inwards at the centre and bulges outwards through the edges,
    making the light diverge.<br><br> They are used to treat myopia as they make faraway objects look smaller than they are.</b></P>

<h2> Convex Lense Glasess</h2>


<p  style="color: rgb(231, 146, 17);"> A convex lens is a type of lens that is thicker in the middle than at the edges. <br><br>
    This shape causes light rays to come together or converge when they pass through it. <br><br>
    Because of this, convex lenses are also known as converging lenses.
    <br><br> They are commonly used in magnifying glasses and to correct farsightedness (hyperopia) by making nearby objects appear clearer. </p>
